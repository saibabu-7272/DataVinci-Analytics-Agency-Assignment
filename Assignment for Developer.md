**Task 1:**

Implement the design for both Desktop and Mobile views as per the provided UI/UX design: [Figma File](https://www.figma.com/design/KuTJztBgGAGZCKGbotH2nU/NZHC-UMF-MGO?node-id=1-2&t=rGX2823gt6Uba7uJ-0)

**Task 2:**

This is a **nested checkbox component**. The intended behavior is:

* Selecting **"Select All"** should check every node.  
* Selecting **"Fruits"** should check all individual fruits.  
* Selecting **"Vegetables"** should check all individual vegetables.

Currently, the logic is broken \- selecting "Fruits" or "Vegetables" does **not** properly check all related items.

**Task 3:**

Record a **Loom video** where you:

* Introduce yourself.  
* Walk through your code.  
* Demonstrate the **responsive layout (task 1\)** and **checkbox functionality** **(task 2\)** in action.
